# Prework-Instagram-Photo-Feed-Project-CH

Everyone knows Instagram, it's an ideal fun exercise to practice your beginner HTML/CSS skills. On this project you will be exercising the following concepts:
  -Reusing CSS classes.
  -Display and Position CSS Rules.
  -Building a layout with CSS/HTML.
  -Centering containers.
  -Flow left and right.
  -Importing images.
  
This is my version #1 of the Instagram Photo Feed Project for the 4Geeks Academy Course.
